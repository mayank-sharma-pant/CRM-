# Multi-Tenant SaaS CRM Platform

A production-grade, multi-tenant CRM system built for service businesses, agencies, and teams. The platform features robust company-level isolation, a sophisticated role-based access control (RBAC) system, financial ledgers, and a comprehensive platform administration layer.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Kanban Pipeline Board**: Drag-and-drop lead management for sales teams.
- **Lead Activity Timeline**: Full audit history of interactions, status changes, and notes for every lead.
- **Bulk CSV Operations**: High-performance bulk lead import and export for managers and MDs.
- **Document Management**: Secure file storage for leads and clients with ownership-based access.
- **Financial Suite**: Professional invoice generation, sales approvals, and automated financial ledgers.
- **Smart Notifications**: Real-time in-app bell notifications for assignments, status updates, and administrative approvals.
- **Custom Report Builder**: Dynamic data visualization for Managing Directors with team-level performance metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** (React 18, App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Modern utility-first styling)
- **Axios** (API client)
- **Recharts** (Dynamic data visualization)
- **Lucide React** (Consistent iconography)

### Backend
- **Python / FastAPI** (High-performance async REST API)
- **SQLAlchemy 2.x** (Modern ORM with typed mapping)
- **Alembic** (Reliable database migrations)
- **PostgreSQL** (Primary relational database)
- **JWT** (Stateless authentication via python-jose)
- **Pydantic v2** (Strict request/response validation)

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The backend is organized into functional domains to maximize maintainability and prevent circular dependencies:
- **`core/`**: Authentication, User Management, Audit Logs, and Company Infrastructure.
- **`sales/`**: Leads, Clients, Tasks, Follow-ups, and Kanban logic.
- **`finance/`**: Invoices, Sales Approvals, and Ledgers.
- **`hr/`**: Employee Leave and Transfer requests.
- **`ops/`**: Document Management, Bulk Processing, and System Monitoring.

### Multi-Tenancy & Security
- **Strict Row-Level Isolation**: Every entity is scoped by `company_id`.
- **`apply_company_scope` Helper**: A centralized security utility that automatically injects company filters into SQL queries, preventing cross-tenant data leaks.
- **Secure ID Policy**: Cross-tenant resource requests return 404 (Not Found) instead of 403 (Forbidden) to prevent resource enumeration attacks.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Node.js 18+

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Environment Configuration
cp .env.example .env
# python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"

# Migrations & Database
createdb local_service_crm
alembic upgrade head

# Run API (dev)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Deployment

**Production Recommendation:**
- **Backend**: Use Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers behind an Nginx reverse proxy.
- **Frontend**: Deploy via Vercel or a standalone Node.js server.
- **Database**: Managed PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS or Supabase).

```bash
# Production execution example
gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app.main:app
```
