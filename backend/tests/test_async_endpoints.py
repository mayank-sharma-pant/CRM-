"""An `async def` endpoint runs on the event loop, so sync database work in it freezes the whole
worker (chat, calls and every other request on it). Plain `def` endpoints run in a thread and are
fine. Async endpoints that take a database session must hand that work to a thread, and are listed
here once reviewed."""
